Most of the societies in our world, those that will decide its future, are above all capitalist societies[^1], whether market-based or mixed. Consequently, they steer, willingly or not, the desires of all members of society toward the aims of capitalism. Over the centuries[^2], as they have gradually conferred the tangible benefits of political liberalism, capitalist society has become the most powerful form of society.

With a subtle totalitarianism, it is ubiquitous: it afflicts individuals with the pains and joys of the pan-economic, while restricting their psyche to the few patterns useful for the reproduction of this society. Consider the workers' assent to professional ethics, the narrow circle of productivist personal development, the idea that human life is almost (hope lies in this 'almost') reduced to accomplishing _tasks_, that comfort is the _summum bonum_, and the useless, the unproductive, the abnormal becoming the subjects of hatred or rejection by citizens and the target of laws enacted by the self-replicating political class.

Therefore, all attempts to save the world in its current form from capitalist society are doomed to failure. No local initiative, on the scale of a single country, can succeed without risking the destruction of the concerned capitalist society by surrounding capitalist societies (economic sanctions that have replaced wars) or, more likely, being fiercely rejected by the citizens themselves. The rise of nationalism compatible with the market economy is a fruitful example: human migration is rejected in the name of irreducible ethnic differences (a return of the 'almost'), while paradoxically being inextricably linked today to the proper functioning of the market economy â€” individuals may have to die in the Mediterranean for this. Thus, the world's salvation can only be global, but it will not come without the unanimous destruction of the human capitalist world as we know it.

> Public opinion must see the merits of the free play of market mechanisms and oppose state interventions aimed at protecting the powerful at the expense of general economic prosperity.

It might not be absurd to claim that _almost_ nothing predisposes the artifice of public opinion in this direction.
