Productivity is not about time management, it's about frustration.

Pushing the "play" button on your keyboard and having Apple Music started, to be closed, then opening manually Spotify.That's the kind of frustration that productivity tackles. Nothing more.

Time management is just another way of treating a "human feature" as resource to handle, to optimize, as if it was even remotely possible without damaging yourself in the short or long run.
