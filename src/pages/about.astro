  <h1>About</h1>
  <section>
    <p>I'm a French web developer, born and raised in the North of France.</p>
    <p>Of course, I love French fries: <i>«&nbsp;La frite c'est la fête&nbsp»</i> 🍟.</p>
    <p>
      My favorite programming concept is <em
        ><strong>seperation of concerns</strong></em
      > as it leads to all golden paths in my opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      My least favorite programming concept is <em><strong>KISS</strong></em> (funny
      isn't it ?).
    </p>
    <p>
      I used to do (bad) mobile and backend (Node.js) code when I started working
      professionally then I switched to <strong>React.js</strong> (w/ Next.js). I
      think frontend development is a field where lot of things could be improved
      (code architecture, styling patterns, rendering modes).
